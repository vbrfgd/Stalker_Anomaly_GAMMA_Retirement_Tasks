# Stalker_Anomaly_GAMMA_Retirement_Tasks
A mod for Stalker Anomaly / GAMMA that add a type of fetch quest allowing stalkers to retire, leaving their weapons to you. It's another way to obtain weapons belonging to your own faction.

In my most recent playthrough as a Merc, I use Warsaw Pact weapons almost exclusively for the first half of the game. That's because Merc is friendly with most other NATO factions (Clear Sky and Freedom), which means they have less chance to loot NATO corpses, and as a result, fewer NATO weapons. The only options, for now, are stashes, which are inconsistent, and RF missions, which can be a nuisance sometimes.

That's why I "made this mod" (by stealing a bunch of codes from other GAMMA mods). The mod should add a type of new fetch quest that requires 200,000 roubles and one high-tier artifact to help people leave the zone: a retiring merc, an ecologist left for Ph.D., or a bandit running from Sultan. Either way, they will not need their weapons anymore and left them for you as a reward.

## Changelogs

7/12/2023: Add a version where gun rewards are always in 100% condition. Located in versions/Full condition guns.

## Instruction

1. Install

First thing first, it goes without saying that you should backup your saves before installing. This is a simple mod, it will not set your PC on fire (probably), but it never hurt to be careful.

Same as any other Anomaly mod. Using Mod Organizer, click on "Install a new mod from an archive".

Choose Retirement_Tasks.zip, then click Open. Name the mod what you like, just don't forget it :v.

If you see this window, I recommend ticking "Keep Backup", then choose Replace.

Make sure Retirement_Tasks (or whatever you named this mod) is loaded AFTER (as in put below in Mod Organizer - I guess) G.A.M.M.A. Dynamic Tasks Balance, then enable the mod.

2. Uninstall

Untick the mod in MO2, then right-click - Remove Mod. It should not be complicated.

3. YOU_SHOULD_KNOW

   - The task can be given by stalkers of factions: Clear Sky, Ecologist, Freedom, Mercenary, Loner, Military, Duty, and Bandit.
   - The task is a fetch quest, and so if viewed with PDA Taskboard, will be in the same place as other fetch quests. The name of the task there is also identical to the "fetch artifact" quest (i.e. "Need: Firefly"). I don't know how to change that name yet. Look at the description. The description of the "retirement task" will be likely longer, since I attempt to tell a story with them.
   - The gun you are given will be, if the mod work correctly, the exact gun the quest giver carries at the time you turn in the quest. Therefore, you can look at what the quest giver carries before accepting it to see if it's worth the hassle.
   - Higher rank stalker will give higher condition gun. At the moment, the exact chances should be:
       - novice:        10-20%
       - trainee:       10-25%
       - experienced:   15-25%
       - professional:  15-30%
       - veteran:       20-30%
       - expert:        20-35%
       - master:        25-35%
       - legend:        25-40%
         
     I copied the code from CONFIGURABLE LOOT CONDITION, but cannot for the life of me figure out how to make an MCM menu, so I had to hardcode it.
   - The quest giver will be UNARMED after you get the reward.
    
4. TO_DO

- Add versions of the files for:
  - Full gun condition as a reward.
  - Require 2 artifacts instead of 1 artifact + 200k.
- Learn how to make an MCM menu.
